			Aang is the protagonist of Avatar: The Last Airbender. He was born among the Air Nomads, the nation that could bend the element 
			of air. Aang found out at a young age that he would be the next avatar and was put into special training. The avatar was the peacemaker 
			and guider of the land, the only person that could manipulate all of the 4 elements. When an avatar dies, they are reincarnated into a new life,
			and Aang is one of those reincarnations. When Aang and his nation found out that he was the new avatar, Aang was secluded and treated differently 
			from how he used to be. Afraid of the immense responsibilites and loneliness of becoming the avatar, Aang fled from his home. 
			While running away, Aang was caught in a dangerous storm, and in an attempt to save his life he froze himself. A hundred years passed 
			and his island of ice made its way into the water nation, where 2 water tribe children found and awoke him. It is here that the start 
			of Avatar: The Last Airbender begins.
